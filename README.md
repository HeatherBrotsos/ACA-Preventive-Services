## ACA Preventive Services ##

_currently work in progress_

As part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), private plans must cover a set of preventive services with no patient [cost sharing](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/cost-sharing/).  

These services are outlined [here](https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-benefits/) by HHS. 

Additional description of these services, including effective dates, other restrictions and background is documented by the [Kaiser Family Foundation](http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/preventive-services-covered-by-private-health-plans/?utm_campaign=KFF%3A+The+Latest&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=21094055&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--zIJs8wbq4DTDh07BVoNAizYbQMiW43pZk7mO4pVSEjJGJhH5W4X9rTlX9UP5-GL8dVrRAXIj_8lezzzPIqS1kloaGF44LvxCoR3yIQ_y0z8dR1Xk&_hsmi=21094055). 

Three organizations contributed recommendations on what services to include:  
- [U.S. Preventive Services Task Force](http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations/)  
-  [Health Resources Services Administration](http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/)  
-[Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html)



### What procedure codes correspond to these services? ###

An initial search for this information began with the HHS Innovation Lab [Demand Driven Open Data project](https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues/44).


While there is no official guidance, CDC published a list of procedure and diagnostic codes that align with these services [here](http://www.cdc.gov/prevention/billingcodes.html#0.1_contraception).  

**Step 1**: Convert the CDC html into a non-normalized .csv  file.



**Step 2**: Transform into tabular format.


**Step 3**: Add relevant restrictions and date each service is effective.
